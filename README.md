# Janot's secondary dotfiles

This config runs on my secondary machine. It's pretty much the same as my [main config](https://github.com/JanotLeLapin/dots), but without the GUIs, and with some extra services, including:

- [QBitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) client
- [XD](https://xd-torrent.github.io/) BitTorrent client
- [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) node
- [I2PD](https://i2pd.website/) node
- Minecraft server
- [Soulseek](https://github.com/slskd/slskd) client
- [MStream](https://mstream.io/) server
